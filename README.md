# Welcome

Hello, My name is GuidedApex. I am a junior developer eager to learn many different languages! I have now been programming for 6 months now and have learnt so much new skills. I am currently working on my server [Voltage](https://discord.gg/fGswqpg2T9) and hope to release it very soon! I am a determined person who believes that anything is possible if you put your mind to it!
